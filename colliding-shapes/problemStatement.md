# Problem Statement
## Develop a Java application that simulates the movement and collision of various shapes within a graphical panel. The shapes should move with random initial velocities, bounce off the panel boundaries, and detect collisions with other shapes. The application should include methods to handle the movement, collision detection, and rendering of the shapes. The collision detection should be implemented using a radius-based approach, and shapes should reverse direction upon collision. User should be able to spawn shapes by clicking with a mouse on the window panel.
